By the time of this driver release, this driver does not implement:
<li>functionality of displaying and harmonic bar chart for voltage and current
<li>functionality of displaying voltage, current and power waveforms.
<li>functionality for start or stop integration process for &quot;Clock Start Method&quot; (in which a clock setting up action will be needed)
<li>functionality to display the integration graph for &quot;Integrator&quot; operation mode
<li>functionality for internal system clock user setup
<li>functionality to display 4 results or 14 results screen on its LCD display
<br> 
<br>
For the above not implemented functions, Voltech Instruments provides IEEE 
488.2 compatible commands for all of them. Please refer to &quot;PM1000+ User Manual&quot; 
if you want to know how to take advantage of the functions described 
above. &quot;PM1000+ User Manual&quot; can be downloaded at
<a href="http://www.voltech.com">www.voltech.com</a></para>
<br>
When constructing your own program, and requesting large quantity of data from 
PM1000+ use the Close.vi provided with this driver.  Otherwise it will at times cause the PM1000+ not to respond to any subsequent commands.
The Close.vi will make sure to close the opening connection to PM1000+ properly and 
prepare the next successful connection for you.  .<br>
